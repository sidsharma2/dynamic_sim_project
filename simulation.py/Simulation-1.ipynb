    "# Exploring Vibrations and Automatic Control: A Short Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi, I’m **Sid Sharma**, a fourth-year undergraduate student in **Mechanical Engineering** at the **University of British Columbia (UBC)**. This project is a personal effort to study vibrations and automatic control, focusing on how dynamic systems behave and how engineers can better predict and influence their motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding vibrations and control systems is fundamental to many areas of engineering, from ensuring the stability of structures to improving the efficiency of machines and robotics. Through this project, I aim to build a practical understanding of these principles while developing essential skills like modeling, simulation, and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I began with a simple plot of a mass-spring-damper system, exploring how key parameters like damping and stiffness affect the system’s behavior. From there, I developed dynamic simulations that allow users to interact with variables and see their effects in real time. Over time, I added features like force-driven responses, magnification factor plots, and additional calculated insights to deepen my analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding into control systems, I created interactive plots where users could adjust control parameters and observe their impact on system stability and performance. This hands-on approach helped me connect theoretical concepts to their practical applications. I am now working on a two-degree-of-freedom inverted pendulum simulation, tackling a classic problem in control engineering to further enhance my skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work has been an excellent way to develop critical engineering competencies like problem-solving, computational modeling, and system design. These skills are directly applicable to research and industry, where the ability to model and control dynamic systems is essential for innovation and effective solutions. By continuing to build on this foundation, I hope to contribute meaningfully to engineering challenges in the future."

    "The **natural frequency** \\( \\omega_n \\) and the **damping ratio** \\( \\zeta \\) are key parameters in the system's behavior. These can be derived from the coefficients of the characteristic equation:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\omega_d = \\omega_n \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}\n",

    "\n",
    "### Critical Damping:\n",
    "Critical damping occurs when \\( \\zeta = 1 \\), which leads to the system returning to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Magnification Factor and Resonance Frequency\n",

    "\n",
    "## Transfer Function and its Application\n",
    "The transfer function plays an essential role in analyzing and controlling the system's behavior. By analyzing the poles and zeros of the transfer function, we can predict the system’s response to different inputs, such as sinusoidal forces or step functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Block Diagram of the System\n",
    "The system can be represented in a block diagram where the input force \\( F(s) \\) is processed through the transfer function \\( G(s) \\), resulting in the output displacement \\( X(s) \\). The system can be analyzed using feedback control strategies to improve stability or response time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Application of the Laplace Transform\n",
    "In control systems, the Laplace transform is used to convert the system's differential equations into algebraic equations that are easier to analyze. The transfer function is crucial for designing controllers that ensure the system behaves as desired under different operating conditions.\n",

    "The solutions to this quadratic equation will give the poles. The nature of these poles—whether they are real or complex—determines the behavior of the system, such as whether it is underdamped, critically damped, or overdamped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bode Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Bode plot** is a graph of the system's frequency response. It consists of two plots: one showing the magnitude and the other showing the phase of the system's transfer function over a range of frequencies. This plot helps us understand how the system will respond to sinusoidal inputs of different frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Magnitude Plot**: The magnitude of the transfer function \\( |G(j\\omega)| \\) versus frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n",
    "\n",

    "The Bode plot is particularly useful for understanding resonance, stability margins, and bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the Laplace transform, we can easily transition from a time-domain system description to a frequency-domain representation. The poles provide insight into system stability, while the Bode plot helps us understand how the system reacts to different frequency inputs. These analyses are foundational in control systems engineering, where system behavior and stability are of utmost importance.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simulation, we model the behavior of a **mass-spring-damper system** under the influence of a **Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller**. The system's response to a disturbance will be analyzed by adjusting the system parameters, including the mass \\(m\\), damping coefficient \\(c\\), spring constant \\(k\\), and the control gains \\(K_p\\) (proportional gain) and \\(K_d\\) (derivative gain).\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation will help us understand the dynamic behavior of the system, including key control aspects such as damping, stability, and control performance. We will visualize the **step response**, the **Bode plot** for frequency response analysis, and **poles** to assess system stability. The aim is to give the user insight into how varying the control gains and system parameters impacts the system's motion and control effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Control Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this system is to control the **displacement** of the mass by applying a PD controller. The controller continuously adjusts the applied force based on the difference between the desired displacement \\(x_{\\text{desired}}\\) and the current displacement \\(x\\), as well as the rate of change of displacement (velocity).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proportional control** reacts to the current error, i.e., the difference between the desired displacement and the current position. **Derivative control** reacts to the rate of change of error, i.e., how fast the error is changing, to prevent overshooting and oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adjusting these parameters, the user can tune the system's response to achieve an optimal balance between fast response and minimal oscillations (damping).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The system can be modeled with the following equation of motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m \\ddot{x} + c \\dot{x} + k x = F_{\\text{control}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( m \\) is the mass of the object\n",
    "- \\( c \\) is the damping coefficient\n",
    "- \\( k \\) is the spring constant\n",
    "- \\( x \\) is the displacement of the mass\n",
    "- \\( F_{\\text{control}} \\) is the control force applied by the PD controller\n",
    "\n",
    "The PD controller can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_{\\text{control}} = K_p (x_{\\text{desired}} - x) + K_d \\dot{x}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "- \\( x_{\\text{desired}} \\) is the desired displacement\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamic System Simulation and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts to Observe\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Step Response**: The system’s response to a step input (disturbance) over time. We are particularly interested in the time it takes for the system to stabilize and the amount of oscillation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Bode Plot**: The Bode plot shows the system’s frequency response, providing insights into stability. This helps assess the gain margin and phase margin, which are important for ensuring stability in the design of controllers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Poles of the System**: The poles are critical for determining system stability. A system is stable if the real part of all poles is negative. The poles can be visualized to show how control affects the system's stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tuning the Controller**: Adjusting the PD gains \\(K_p\\) and \\(K_d\\) influences the system's response:\n",
    "   - A higher \\(K_p\\) results in a faster response but may cause overshooting or oscillations.\n",
    "   - A higher \\(K_d\\) increases damping, reducing overshoot and improving stability but may slow down the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "Using sliders, the user can control:\n",
    "- The **mass** \\(m\\), **damping** \\(c\\), and **spring constant** \\(k\\), which directly affect the natural frequency and damping of the system.\n",
    "- The **desired displacement** \\(x_{\\text{desired}}\\), which is the target position for the mass.\n",
    "- The **PD controller gains** \\(K_p\\) and \\(K_d\\), allowing the user to experiment with different control strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Output\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Displacement over Time**: Shows the system's response to the disturbance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Bode Plot**: Displays the frequency response and allows the user to analyze how the system behaves at different frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Poles**: These indicate the stability of the system, helping the user understand how the system’s dynamics are affected by the controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Control Performance**: With the Bode plot and time-domain response, the user can optimize control by adjusting the PD gains and system parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The PD controller offers a mechanism to control the dynamic behavior of the mass-spring-damper system. By varying the controller gains and system parameters, users can understand the impact of each on the system’s stability and performance. This simulation serves as an introduction to automatic control theory, providing hands-on experience with a simple mechanical system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "- **Proportional control** increases responsiveness but can lead to overshoot.\n",
    "- **Derivative control** helps reduce overshoot and improves stability.\n",
    "- **Poles** and the **Bode plot** provide essential information for tuning the system and ensuring stability.\n",
    "- **Optimization**: The optimal PD gains depend on the system’s damping ratio and natural frequency, which can be adjusted to achieve the desired performance in terms of settling time and overshoot.\n",
    "\n",
    "By simulating the system and adjusting parameters interactively, users gain valuable insight into the role of control in shaping system dynamics."

    "I have modified the physical parameters of the pendulum system, introducing damping and adjusting the lengths and masses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gravitational acceleration**: \n",
    "  - \\( g = 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Damping**: A damping coefficient has been added to the system to prevent it from crashing within a few seconds and to ensure stable simulation dynamics. For ease of algebra, the damping will not be included in the equations, as they get very, very long.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Equations of Motion and Normal Mode Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For small angles, we approximate the forces involved in the pendulum's movement. Using the equations for the forces acting on each pendulum, the system dynamics are simplified. The resulting equations of motion for the three pendulums are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m_1 \\ddot{x}_1 = T_2 \\sin(\\theta_2) - T_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) - \\beta_1 \\dot{x}_1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m_2 \\ddot{x}_2 = T_3 \\sin(\\theta_3) - T_2 \\sin(\\theta_2) - \\beta_2 \\dot{x}_2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m_3 \\ddot{x}_3 = -T_3 \\sin(\\theta_3) - \\beta_3 \\dot{x}_3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\(T_1\\), \\(T_2\\), and \\(T_3\\) are the tensions in the rods between the pendulums, and \\(x_1, x_2, x_3\\) represent the displacements of the pendulums. The terms \\(\\beta_1\\), \\(\\beta_2\\), and \\(\\beta_3\\) represent the damping coefficients applied to each pendulum.\n",
    "\n",
    "For small oscillations, we simplify the equations using small-angle approximations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ddot{x}_1 + \\omega_0^2 (ax_1 - bx_2) = R \\omega_0^2 \\eta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ddot{x}_2 + \\omega_0^2 (-ax_1 + bx_2 - cx_3) = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ddot{x}_3 + \\omega_0^2 (cx_3 - ax_2) = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here: a,b,c,R are all coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to a system of linear equations that can be solved for the **normal modes** of oscillation. The system is represented in matrix form as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where **A** is the coefficient matrix, **x** is the vector of amplitudes, and **b** is the source vector. Solving this system yields the **normal mode frequencies** and **relative amplitudes** for the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying Kane's Method\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a **nonholonomic system**, Kane’s method is particularly useful as it avoids the need to introduce Lagrange multipliers. Kane’s method is based on generalized coordinates and partial velocities, which makes it easier to derive the equations of motion for complex systems such as the triple pendulum. For the triple pendulum, we apply the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Partial Velocities**: These represent the velocities of the particles (or pendulums) as functions of motion variables.\n",
    "2. **Partial Angular Velocities**: These describe the angular velocities of the pendulums in relation to the motion variables.\n",
    "3. **Generalized Active and Inertial Forces**: Kane’s method allows us to compute these forces without needing to directly handle constraint forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Normal Mode Frequencies and Mode Shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "The **normal mode frequencies** can be found by solving the determinant of the coefficient matrix. These frequencies represent independent oscillations in the system. We will analyze the **mode shapes** to understand how energy propagates through the system and how the pendulums interact with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dealing with Nonholonomic Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "A **nonholonomic system** is one where the motion is subject to constraints that cannot be expressed purely in terms of generalized coordinates. For the triple pendulum, we consider constraints such as rolling or absence of slipping. Kane’s method conveniently handles these constraints by defining appropriate partial velocities and partial angular velocities, thus avoiding the need to explicitly introduce Lagrange multipliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Incorporating Attitude Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "The motion of rigid bodies, like pendulums, is governed by their **attitude dynamics**, which describe their orientation relative to a fixed reference frame. We will incorporate this into the simulation to ensure accurate modeling of the pendulum's motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Process Ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "I will follow these steps:\n",
    "1. **Derive the equations of motion** using Kane’s method.\n",
    "2. **Solve the system for the normal modes and amplitudes**.\n",
    "3. **Implement the control strategy** to stabilize the system.\n",
    "4. **Simulate and visualize** the system's response under control.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualizing the Forces\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below, we show the forces acting on the individual pendulums. This helps us understand how tension and gravitational forces contribute to the motion.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Video Link\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more dynamic view of the triple pendulum in action, watch the following video I made in python showcasing its motion (took a lot of iterating to optimize the masses, lengths, starting angles, and damping such that the model did not crash):\n",
    "\n",
    "<video width=\"640\" height=\"480\" controls>\n",
    "  <source src=\"tripendulum_animation.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n",
    "  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n",
    "</video>\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will provide me with the insights needed to analyze the system’s behavior, understand its instability, and attempt stabilization using feedback control. This work is crucial for understanding the complexities of **spacecraft dynamics** in environments where chaotic motion is common, such as in the **Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP)**. The CR3BP has been extensively studied, but fewer studies incorporate the effects of spacecraft attitude dynamics, making this simulation a step towards modeling such complex systems."
